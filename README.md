## The AssociateProfitSplitter
Firstly, I opened up my crypto account on metamask and Ganache, successfully connected both to the local network on my computer. 
Then started REMIC IDE for Ethereum to create two smart contacts.

My motivation for creating these contracts is to help shape business processes in new and exciting ways using blockchain technology, hence ensuring that such process can be transparent, censor resistant, Neutral Borderless and truly open.

The first contract I am creating is the Profit Splitter contract that can be used by business partnerships in splitting profits or proceeds from a business. This can also be used by human resource professionals to pay employees or companies to suppliers using Ethereum. I was able to compile and deploy the contract by connecting to Injected Web3 and ensuring MetaMask is pointed to localhost:8545.  I tested the deposit function by sending different amounts of ether to the contract to ensure the logic is executing properly

## The TieredProfitSplitter
The second contract is a Tiered profit splitter, similar to the above, but most likely useful to companies paying debt or equity holders from their free cash flow in Ethereum. Depending on the level of surbordination, debt payment is typically tiered, with equity holders being the last most juniot claim to profits. Hence, similar to the above, I was able to compile and deploy the contract by connecting to Injected Web3 and ensuring MetaMask is pointed to localhost:8545.  I tested the deposit function by sending different amounts of ether to the contract to ensure the logic is executing properly

## The DeferredEquityPlan
The third contract is the deferred equity plan contract, most likely useful to treasurers and pensionn fund adminsitrators paying pensioners an accumulated contribution of their pensions (equity). Hence, similar to the above, I was able to compile and deploy the contract by connecting to Injected Web3 and ensuring MetaMask is pointed to localhost:8545.  I tested the deposit function by sending different amounts of ether to the contract to ensure the logic is executing properly
